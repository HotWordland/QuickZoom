As [Zoom](https://zoom.us) becomes more and more popular, in our daily work, there may be many scenes where Zoom multi-person meetings are used every day. But every time you have to copy the Zoom account and password from the email, sometimes because the password contains spaces, it will cause you to be unable to join the meeting.

[QuickZoom](https://github.com/Jinxiansen/QuickZoom) can help you quickly join the Zoom meeting, reducing the tedious copy and paste, and the probability of errors when copying.

When you copy the Zoom link, you automatically join the meeting.
